# Go Faster Example Code

The [Go Faster book](https://leanpub.com/gofaster) has many code examples to accompany the text.

I'm listing them here together with a link to the executable code on the Go Playground (where applicable).

There's no explainer text to accompany the examples, that's in the book, but the examples are designed strip away
the noise to highlight the principles being demonstrated.

They may well be enough as-is, but, if not please consider [purchasing my book](https://leanpub.com/gofaster). It's inexpensive and
thorough and I'm confident it will help you learn Go, faster.
